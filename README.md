# ERL-DDE
Run the `main.py` file to train the ERL-DDE. The training cases are located in the `case_code` directory, which consists of 1000 different cases of the same scale. This folder also includes the `case.py` script for generating these cases. Fifteen test cases can be found in the `case_code/test` subdirectory.
